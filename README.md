# Niyantri Beans & Brew

A minimal, responsive coffee shop website with a warm coffee-color theme and a PayPal integration for the cart checkout.

What you get:

- Five pages: Home (index.html), Menu (menu.html), Cart (cart.html), About (about.html), Contact (contact.html)
- Fluid, full-width content using Tailwind CSS classes
- PayPal Checkout on the Cart page
- Placeholder images using descriptive placeholders
- A README with how to run locally

How to run locally:

1. Open the site by double-clicking index.html in your browser, or run a simple static server in the project folder.
2. Navigate to Menu to add items to the cart. The cart persists in localStorage.
3. On Cart, you can review items and pay with PayPal (sandbox mode using client-id 'sb').

Notes:
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS utility classes. The main content blocks fill the full width of the viewport.
- The PayPal button uses a sandbox client-id for demonstration.
